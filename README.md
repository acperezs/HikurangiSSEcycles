# HikurangiSSEcycles
Description: Data products for "Segmentation of shallow slow slip events at the Hikurangi subduction zone explained by along-strike changes in fault geometry and plate convergence rates" by A. Perez-Silva, Y. Kaneko, M. Savage, L. Wallace, D. Li, C. Williams.

DATA

Mesh:
The model assumes a 3D fault geometry of the Hikurangi plate interface based on Williams et al. 2013. Our model fault extends 500 km along the Hikurangi margin  and covers the depth range from the trench, at 2.5 km depth below sea level, down to 30 km. We discretize the slab surface by 84906 triangular elements using Cubit/Trelis Software (https://www.coreform.com/) with each triangular element having an area of ~1 km^2. 

Parameter setup:
1. Distribution of friction parameter (a - b) and effective normal stress (Figure 2a and 2b)
2. Length of velocity-weakening region in SSE source region (W) (Figure 2c and 2f)

Evolution of slip rate:
1. Slip rate along the fault strike (Figure 5a)

Slip distribution:
1. Cumulative slip of SSEs between 55 to 75 years (Figure 7a)
2. Slip budget on the fault over 100 years (Figure 7d)

Recurrence interval:
1. Recurrence interval at P1, P2 and P3 for models M1-M4 (Figure 9)

Movies:
Movie S1. Sliprate evolution on the fault as shown in Figure 4.
